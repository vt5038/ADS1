# Gun Violence Prediction using Social Media Chatter
This is a research project on "Gun Violence Prediction using Social Media Chatter" conducted at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA. This research aims to address the critical issue of gun violence through social media.

# Project Overview
Our work focuses on collecting, analyzing, and predicting gun violence threats by mining social media posts. By employing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, we analyze sentiments, named entities, and knowledge graphs derived from various social media platforms. Our goal is to build an accurate model that helps in the timely prediction and prevention of potential incidents.

## Dataset Overview
Our project utilizes a dataset, titled "Gun_Violence_Record_Original," which is important in understanding and predicting gun violence. This dataset is collected from gun violence archive and is publically available at https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/ .

# Code Overview
This section of the repository contains the primary Jupyter Notebook "ADS1_Preliminary.ipynb", which outlines the preliminary analysis and modeling work for our Gun violence prediction Chatter using Social Media project.
1. Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for cleaning and preprocessing for certain columns.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Includes visualizations and initial insights derived from the dataset.
